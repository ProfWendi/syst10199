week 13 questions

1. to separate related controller tasks and make the code more modular/re-usable
2. any url starting with menu/ followed by any number of path segments (or no path segments)
3. http doesn't "remember" you between one request/response cycle and the next:
when you connect to the server to make a request and then the response is sent, the server has no memory of that request
4. session = a browsing session, can also refer to the session data/properties
A session is used to store data about the client in between request/response cycles
5. sessions store the data on the server instead of on the client machine, except 
for the session id cookie; cookies store all data on the client machine
when subsequent requests are made, the server checks for the session cookie and uses it to look up the stored data 
with cookies, cookies are sent back to the server, the server can read and modify them and send them back to the client
6. a session begins when the user visits the domain for the first time, or when they visit the domain for the first time after a previous session has expired
sessions end when the session cookie expires, when the code programmatically destroys/invalidates the session, or when the app/server stops/restarts
7. session cookie contains the session id, it's used to uniquely identify a specific session
it's used as they key to look up the stored session data for that session 
the session cookie is passed back and forth between client and server in each request/response
