week 5 dom

questions
1. bom = browser object model, dom = document object model
the dom = all the objects (and their properties/functions) that make up the web document and all its elements and content
- the dom is for any kind of document e.g. xml, not just html documents
the bom = the objects (and their properties/functions) that make up the parts of the browser that you can work with using JS

2. navigator contains properties with information about the browser software and 
location contains properties about the current URL and functions that do things like redirect to a different URL
window for the current window/tab, contains functions for showing dialogs, getting the computed style of document objects, etc

3. the window object owns other objects that are used in scripts such as the console, document, history, location, navigation;
it also has properties such as height and width, those that allow access to the location bar, menu bar, toolbar, and status bar;
it also has functions such as those for dialogs, managing timers, fetching resources, retrieving computed styles, and manage window state e.g. close/open

4. prompt(), alert(), confirm(), console object e.g. console.log() is actually window.console.log()
later: getComputedStyle()

5. the document object represents the current document in the current browser tab/window where the script is running
it contains properties with document information such as lastModified, and properties that allow access to various parts of the document (e.g. document.head, document.body, document.children, etc.)
it also contains methods that allow you to manipulate the DOM such as append/prepend/before/after(), createElement(), createAttribute(), createTextNode(), and functions that allow access to DOM objects such as querySelector/All().

6. you can use any language to manipulate the DOM, not just JavaScript

7. element nodes model elements, text nodes model all the text/characters in a document, and attribute nodes model the attributes that belong to elements

8. <header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>

9. <h2>, <p>, <aside>, <p>

10. <h3>, <p>, <figure>, <img>, <figcaption>

11. <p>, <p>, <h3>, <figure>
